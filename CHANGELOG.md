# ChangeLog

## 0.0.4

Tweaked breadcrumbs, sidebar selection, and more in a subtle way.
This release focuses on making Green Breeze Light to match with its dark version.

## 0.0.3

Improvement for terminal colour. It is especially easier to read black on blue text.

## 0.0.2

This version was skipped on Git since the next improvement came out pretty quickly.
Fix color for invalid text; the vscode themes website did not have the feature to edit these, and this theme will be different from the website version.
Also changed the color of "variables/properties" to a little darker one so that you can distinguish between keywords and variables/properties.

## 0.0.1

Currently this is the first version.
